This directory contains CTest scripts for running automated builds and testing
of the OSEHR code base. In this directory the vista_common.cmake is the
main ctest driver script. For each site that is submitting automated
tests a directory should be created with the domain name for the site. In that
directory, there should be a machinename.cmake file and a machinename.bat or
machinename.sh file.  The .bat or .sh file will run ctest -S
machinename.cmake and setup any environment variables required for the
build. The .bat and .sh files will be run via crontab or scheulded
tasks.
